# the > denotes the serving position line
# the >> denotes the types of serves the players do
#        s for spin,  f for float,  h for hybrid
# seperated by > from the rest with spaces in between is the starting lineup for each set
#        the number which has an S behind it is the setter
# the first part of each group denotes the action
#        . is serve    .. is reception
#        set is an extension of reception
#        hitting is an extension of setting
# serve can look like . .... .
#        the second part denotes the zone 1 - 9
#        the third part denotes the outcome 1 - 5, ace - good - bad - err - came back over
#        which player served, can be inferred from the data and the starting lineup
# reception can look like .. ..... ...
#        the second part denotes the position which received
#                this should only be 1 - 6 - 5 - 3,  position 3 is just always the middleblocker in front
#        the third part denotes the quality 1 - 5, good - mehh - bad - aced - back over
#        which player received, can be inferred from the data and the starting lineup
# set can look like (.. ..... .) ...
#        the fourth part denotes the position 1 - 6
#        which player set, can be inferred from the starting lineup
# hit can look lke (.. ..... . ...) .... .... ...
#        the fifth part denotes the type of set, for middles it can be 1 - 4, fast - push - shoot - back fast
#                 for outsides and opposites and pipes its just always 1, since I cant be bothered to track their different sets
#        the sixth part denotes the zone to which they hit 1 - 5, see picture.
#                for outsides and opposites zone 1 is the most diagonal zone,  for middles zone one is to their right
#        the seventh part denotes the outcome 1 - 5, point - defended - came back over - err - rebound
#                if it came back over for simplicity it is always assumed to be a perfect reception and the next part starts over at the set
#                if it is a rebound it is also assumed to just be received high and the next part starts over at the set
# , denotes "came back over + defense"    ,, denotes "came back over + free ball"
# - denotes that the setter attacked himself
